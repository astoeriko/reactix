# Installing Kinetix

## Requirements

Kinetix requires Python 3.11 or later. The package depends on several scientific computing libraries:

- **JAX**: For automatic differentiation and JIT compilation
- **NumPy**: For numerical arrays
- **PyMC**: For Bayesian inference
- **ArviZ**: For Bayesian data analysis
- **Equinox**: For PyTree-compatible differential equations
- **Diffrax**: For differential equation solving

## Installation Methods

### From Source (Recommended)

Since Kinetix is currently in development, installation from source is recommended:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/kinetix.git
cd kinetix
pip install -e .
```

This will install Kinetix in development mode, allowing you to easily update the code and contribute changes.

### Using Pixi (Development Environment)

The project uses [Pixi](https://pixi.sh/) for dependency management. If you have Pixi installed:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/kinetix.git
cd kinetix
pixi install
pixi shell
```

This will create an isolated environment with all dependencies properly configured.

## Verify Installation

You can verify that Kinetix is installed correctly by running:

```python
import kinetix
print("Kinetix installed successfully!")

# Test basic functionality
from kinetix import declare_species, System
Species = declare_species(["tracer"])
print("Species declaration works!")
```

## GPU Support

Kinetix leverages JAX, which can run on GPUs for enhanced performance. To enable GPU support:

### NVIDIA GPUs (CUDA)

```bash
pip install --upgrade "jax[cuda12_pip]" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html
```

### AMD GPUs (ROCm)

```bash
pip install --upgrade "jax[rocm]" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_rocm_releases.html
```

### Apple Silicon (Metal)

JAX has experimental Metal support for Apple Silicon Macs:

```bash
pip install --upgrade "jax[metal]"
```

## Development Installation

If you plan to contribute to Kinetix development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/kinetix.git
cd kinetix
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

This installs additional development dependencies for testing, linting, and documentation.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Import errors**: Make sure all dependencies are installed. Try reinstalling with:
```bash
pip install --upgrade kinetix
```

**JAX installation issues**: JAX installation can be platform-specific. Refer to the [JAX installation guide](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) for detailed instructions.

**PyMC compatibility**: Ensure you have compatible versions of PyMC and its dependencies. The project is tested with PyMC 5.0+.

### Getting Help
